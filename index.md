# ERP Journey!

Yep, you heard right! I will be building an ERP system in Java!

## Architecture
### Software:
Let's look at the lineup of winning technologies:
- Java SE
- JavaFX
- CSS (for customizing the GUI)
- PostgreSQL (for data persistence)
- JPA for accessing this data
- JUnit5 & Mockito for testing

How can all this be accomplished?

### Tools and Methodologies:
- [Jira](https://thomaspaul.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WAR/boards/1/backlog)
- Intellij CE & Eclispe [Comparison](https://thomaspaul.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CL/overview)
- TDD
- [Clean coding](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) (_thank you Uncle Bob!_)

## Day 1

To start with, I created some user stories in JIRA and this Github Page to catalogue my journey.
After setting up the first sprint, I banged out a perfect program...WAIT!!!

Superior software arises from design considerations, let's look at some UML and flowcharts I created.
