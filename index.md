# ERP Journey!

Yep, you heard right! I will be building an ERP system in Java!

## Software:
Let's look at the lineup of winning technologies:
- Java SE
- JavaFX
- CSS (for customizing the GUI)
- PostgreSQL (for data persistence)
- JPA for accessing this data
- JUnit5 & Mockito for testing

How can all this be accomplished?

## Tools and Methodologies:
- Jira
- Intellij CE & Eclispe [Comparison](https://thomaspaul.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CL/overview)
- TDD
- [Clean coding](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) (_thank you Uncle Bob!_)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ThomasHPaul/thomashpaul.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
